Ordinarily I wouldn't leave the IntelliJ project files in the repository; however, seeing as though this is an IntelliJ plugin it seemed appropriate.

This is a barebones plugin which is based on the Google search example provided by JetBrains. I created it in order to introduce myself to creating plugins for IntelliJ IDEA.
